echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

`sudo apt-get update`

## Have Docker Desktop opened in the background or

For Linux (idk about Windows and can't be fucked honestly)

`sudo service docker start`

Check if Docker is running

`sudo service docker status`

## Setting up Laravel Sail

First of all, find a snug comfy place for your project to rest

`mkdir ProjectFolder`

Go into said folder

`cd ProjectFolder`

Download the Docker Compose image

`curl -s "https://laravel.build/finalproject" | bash`

Go into the project folder

`cd finalproject`

Makes your life easier

`alias sail='[ -f sail ] && sh sail || sh vendor/bin/sail'`

Build the server for the first time

`sail up`

After the terminal calms the fuck down

`sail down` or `Ctrl+C` that shit if you can't

Add permissions to storage directory

`sudo chmod o+w ./storage/ -R`

`sudo chown -R www-data:www-data *`

Run the application again

`sail up -d`

Wait til all the containers are running then

`sail artisan storage:link`

To connect to the page, go to `localhost`
