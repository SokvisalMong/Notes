# File states

## Tracking

Files in the repo has 2 states:

- Tracked: Git knows this file and is added to the repo.
- Untracked: Git knows this file but isn't added to the repo.

## Staging

Staged files are ones that are ready to be commited, a commit is an individual change to a file (or set of files).
