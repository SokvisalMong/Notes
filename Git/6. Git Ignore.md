# Git Ignore

You can choose what part of the projects you wish to not share.

Examples: 

- Log files
- Temp files
- Hidden files
- Personal files
- Etc.

You can specify this using a `.gitignore` file.

Files and folders specified in `.gitignore` will not be tracked, but the `.gitignore` file it self will.

If you want to hide what you are hiding in the `.gitignore` file, this needs to be specificed in `.git/info/exclude`.

It works the same way as `.gitignore` but it is hdiden from everyone else.
