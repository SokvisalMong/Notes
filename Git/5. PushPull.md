# Pushing to Github

To push the local repo to the online repo's master branch

`git push origin master`

The way to use push is

`git push origin <branch>`

Example: 

`git push origin develop`

# Pulling from Github

Pull is a combination of 2 commands:

- `fetch`
- `merge`

### Fetch

To grab the latest changes from the origin, use `fetch`

`git fetch origin`

This grabs the latest master branch from github and saves it in the hidden file.

We can also check the difference between our local repo and the latest one using `diff`

`git diff origin/master`

## Merge

Once you confirm everything is ready, you can merge your local repo and the recently fetched one.

`git merge origin/master`

## The short-way

This is what pull is, a mix of fetch and merge but into 1 command.

`git pull origin`

## Pulling a branch from Github directly

If you have the latest revision of the project in your repo. You can use the tag `-a` with `branch` to see all the online branches.

`git branch -a`

You can then use `checkout` like you would a local repo.

`git checkout develop`

After which, this branch will not be available in your local repo.
