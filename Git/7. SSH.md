# SSH

For this part, we'll be assuming you understand what SSH is and the basics.

## Creating an SSH key

First of all, if you don't have an SSH key, create one using your email as a label

`ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "smong@paragoniu.edu.kh"`

After creating an SSH key, we can now pair it

`ssh-add <directory of where you saved the key>`

To use default directory, simply

`ssh-add`

Now you can copy the public key to your clipboard

`clip < <public key location>`

Example:

`clip < /c/Users/User/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

## Setting up SSH key with Github

Now you can go to Github settings and add your key to it.

To test your SSH connection to Github

`ssh -T git@github.com`

## Setting up SSH remote with your repo

To set a remote using SSH

First, Find the SSH address from Github.

Then set it to be the remote origin

`git remote add ssh-origin git@github.com:SokvisalMong/LearningGit.git`

If you want to convert an existing remote origin from HTTPS to SSH do so by

`git remote set-url origin git@github.com:SokvisalMong/LearningGit.git`
